First of all, let me introduce myself, I am Abdulrahman Abu Samhadana and recently. I have finished my B.Sc degree in Mechatronics Engineering from Alazhar university.

I am eager to adopt and learn about new technologies.



I always had the passion for programming and logical applications, starting from the simplest languages like Assembly, C and C++ moving to more complicated languages like Java where I learned about sensitive and important topics like OOP, and also Other programming applications like Arduino and PIC, and recently I have been keen to learn more about programming and to start my professional career as a programmer, and I made some progress using online recourses.



That’s when I saw the Coding Academy advertisement, I think it’s a great opportunity for people like me, as it will support me in my journey in this field. And will absolutely cover a lot of edges where I lack skills.



I have been attending the Saturday program “coding for everyone” and it’s been a good help.



Moreover, as It’s a great opportunity I understand that this program requires hard working, continuous efforts and responsibility. I am already paying a lot of attention towards learning but If I was accepted I will increase it and be ahead for whatever tasks or classes I will attend.
